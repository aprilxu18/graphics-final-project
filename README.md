new term as it comes from video games like Octopath Traveler, and refers
to a realistic shaders added onto combination of 2D sprites and 3D Objects

# How To Run
You can run the project by cloning it and using a live server like express to open the index.html
We recommend using vscode's live server extension as that is what we used, along with Google Chrome,
as Safari does not work the best with the live server.

The website can also be found on https://kazar4.com/graphics/index.html
